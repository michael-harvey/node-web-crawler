# Simple Web Crawler

This web crawler recursively navigates through HTML pages on a target URL and compiles a list of internal site links.

## How to use

Using your terminal, run the command `npm run start [target-url]`, replacing [target-url] with the domain you want to crawl.

Now, go get crawling!

## Node.js

The project specific node.js version is set in the `.nvmrc` file. Use `nvm use` to switch version.
